### For Local Development

* Make sure you have at least Node 4.3. `node --version`
* Clone this repo and change directory to it.
* `npm install`
* Install mongo locally using http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
* Run `mongo` to connect to your database, just to make sure it's working. Once you see a mongo prompt, exit with Control-D
* Run the server with: `npm start`
* By default it will use a path of /parse for the API routes.
* You now have a database named that contains your Parse data
